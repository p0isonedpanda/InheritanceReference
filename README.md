# InheritanceReference
Just a quick reference to inheritance in C#, taken from Brackey's tutorial on YouTube

I quickly realised while working on some projects that inheritance would be insanely useful, and since it's something so integral OO programming it was basically a crime to *not* learn about inheritance, so I created this application based off Brackey's tutorial on YouTube so that I may also use it as a reference int he future.
